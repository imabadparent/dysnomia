# dysnomia
A discord bot library written in Zig

This project is a work-in-progress, so current API coverage is very low. However,
unimplemented features are currently passed through as raw `json.Value`s, so most
things can still be done. I hope to reach full coverage in the future, but I make
no guarantees.

## Name
Dysnomia is the daughter of Eris, Greek goddess of discord, and I liked the idea
of keeping the theme of mythology-inspired names. I was also struggling to find
a name for the project, and dysnomia happens to also mean the inability to recall
names, which fit pretty well.
